  <!--The Problem-->
    <section class="problem">
      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>There has been an abrupt shift to a remote service model for rehabilitation therapies since the COVID19 outbreak. It is difficult to track clients, manage caseload, and organize therapy materials without the physical office space.</p>
    </section>
  <!--The Solution-->
    <section class="solution">
      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p>TheraShelf includes features that allow therapists to manage  caseloads, track client progress, organize treatment materials, and collaborate with other therapy professionals. It creates a streamlined, transparent experience from start to finish.</p>

    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
  <!--Surveys-->
    <section class="surveys">
      <h4>Surveys</h4>
      <p>I conducted a survey with 20 respondants to gain a better understanding of user’s experiences with cloud storage products. I included questions that explored specific motivations, feature rankings, and pain points. The key takeaways include:</p>
      <div class="Chart-one">
        <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Piechart_One.SVG" alt="TheraShelf Solution">
        <p>Currently use a cloud storage product for therapy related tasks</p>

      <div class="Chart-two">
        <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Piechart_Two.SVG" alt="TheraShelf Solution">
        <p>Would use a cloud storage product designed for remote therapy</p>

        <h4>Top Ranked Features</h4>
        <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Bar_graphs.SVG" alt="TheraShelf Solution">
        <p>The top ranked features were considered carefully down the road when prioritzing user stories. They are logical choices to include in the MVP.</p>

  <!--Competitive Analysis-->
    <section class="competitive-analysis">
      <div class="analysis">
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>An analysis was completed with some popular cloud storage products that are already on the market. Common strengths included simple, clean designs with strong visuals to communicate hierarchy of information. None of these products had specialized features that met the specific needs of healthcare workers.</p>

  <!--Personas-->
    <section class="Personas">
      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <p>After completing my initial survey analysis, I had follow up conversations with two of the respondants. I gained a more thorough understanding of their frustations, goals, and attitudes towards cloud storage products. I developed personas to represent an inclusive and full spectrum representation of TheraShelf users. I would go on to reference these personas frequently when making design decisions for the product.</p>

  <!--User Stories-->
    <section class="user-stories">
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>I wrote user stories to account for the most important features per survey and SWOT analysis results. These stories were used to create the MVP that would eventually move into usability testing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I want to log into my account</li>
        <li>I want to view my scheduled visits for today</li>
        <li> I want to assign materials to a specific client</li>
        <li>I want to view a client's overview and medical records</li>
        <li>I want to contact fellow therapists </li>

      <button type="button">View All User Stories</button>
    </section>
  <!--User Flows-->
    <section class="user-flows">
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>I created user flows to represent how a user would interact with TheraSelf to accomplish the high priority user stories. From there, a site map was created to help organize the destinations for each of the user flows.</p>

  <!--Wireframes-->
    <section class="wireframes">
      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>It was finally time to put pen to paper. I started by sketching out possible layouts for the product pages based on the main user flows. Rapid iterations allowed me to make some initial design decisions quickly and efficiently. I then created digital wireframes for my first round of usability testing.</p>
      <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Wireframes.SVG" alt="Wireframes">
    </section>
  <!--User Testing One-->
    <section class="user-testing">
      <h4>Put it to the Test</h4>
      <p>Using my low fidelity wire frames for reference, I created a clickable prototype in Figma. I completed remote usability testing with three participants to assess the effectiveness of the product design. They were presented with the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new account</li>
        <li>View today’s visits</li>
        <li>View a client’s chart</li>
        <li>Assign a note to your client</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The usability testing exposed several features that were problematic to the overall function of the product. These areas were revisited, tweaked, and/or replaced with more effective solutions.</p>
      <div class="problem-quote">
        <p>“The first page feels a little cluttered. I get the toolbar but I think there should be some easier ways to get  to the most important things.”</p>

        <p>There was a bit of an overhaul to the dashboard page. The bottom toolbar was removed completely and a hamburger menu was added instead. This design uses space more effectively on the mobile screen while eliminating the need for ambiguous icons. The metrics were replaced with buttons to allow direct access to recent and/or most used features. Visuals were added to supplement the text information.</p>

  <!--Branding-->
    <section class="branding">
      <h4>Making the Brand</h4>
      <p>It’s time to define the TheraShelf brand. When making branding decisions, I carefully considered the target audience, user personas, and overarching goals of the product. The overall feel of the brand is intended to promote healing, growth, and simplicity. These traits are ideal for a health care product that centers around the rehabilitation process.</p>
      <h5>Color Palette</h5>
      <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Color_Palette.SVG" alt="Color Palette">
      <p>The primary color for TheraShelf is a bright blue, which represents trust, tranqulity, and knowledge. Several of the secondary colors also fall in the blue and green families to communicate growth and healing. Strategic pops of color are used sparingly to highlight information in the product. </p>
      <h5>Typography</h5>
      <p>Both the primary brand typeface and complementary typeface are geometric sans-serif fonts. The typefaces are clean and easy to read at all sizes. It translates well from desktop to a mobile platform.</p>

  <!--Preference Testing-->
    <section class="preference-testing">
      <h4>Preference Testing</h4>
      <p>I considered different configurations for the tab bar on the client overview page. Users were able to choose between the bubble feature or underline feature to highlight the specific tab during page navigation. The majority of users preferred the bubble feature since it was clearer and more eye catching compared to the underline option. </p>
      <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/Preference_testing.SVG" alt="Preference Testing">
    </section>
  <!--Prototyping & Testing-->
    <section>
      <div class="Prototyping">
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>A high fidelity prototype was created in Figma. I was careful to include the visual elements defined by the branding guidlines and preference testing. The visual elements were combined with the strategic layout of the product page to create an intuitive user experience. </p>
        <img class="TheraShelf-Preview" src="Images/TheraShelf_preview.SVG" alt="Preference Testing">
      </div>
      <div class="User-testing">
        <h4>Another Round of Testing</h4>
        <p>I completed another round of remote usability testing with the high fidelity prototype. This time the tasks included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new account</li>
          <li>View today’s visits</li>
          <li>View a client’s chart</li>
          <li>Assign a note to your client</li>
          <li>Look up a therapist’s email address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again, I received constructive feed back for additional changes that needed to be made to improve TheraShelf.</p>
        <div class="problem-quote">
          <p>“It’s strange that there are just search icons on some pages but search bars on others.”</p>
        </div>
        <p>This was an easy fix. The search icon was eliminated and replaced with a full search bar on the file page. This change improves element consistency from page to page. It also ensures that the user expectations are met throughout the product.</p>

  <!--Conclusion-->
    <section>
      <h3>Time to Wrap Things Up</h3>
      <h4>What's Next</h4>
      <p>Next steps would be to implement more of the low priority user stories to make a complete product with specialized features for health care professions. For example, adding templated notes will allow the users to be more efficient and organized when creating content. I would follow that up with another round of usability testing and revisions as needed.</p>
      <h4>My Take Aways</h4>
      <p>This project alowed me to mature and gain strong footing as a UX designer.  I learned to check my personal expectations throughout the different phases of the design process. My ideations did not necessarily translate as clearly and effectively as I intended during user testing. However, I was able to  embrace the design process and rely on user feedback to work through several iterations of the product. Designs that fall back on data and tangible research create the best user experience. </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p> TheraShelf underwent some major and minor changes to the design elements and layout. At the end of the day, TheraShelf finds its place amoungst other cloud storage products by targeting a niche health care audience. It provides creative solutions to our new remote world. </p>
